Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich yet ... so I might give up and start trading Apple stocks all day instead.

First, I wanna know how much money I could have made yesterday if I'd been trading Apple stocks all day.

So I grabbed Apple's stock prices from yesterday and put them in an array called stockPrices, where:

The indices are the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
The values are the price (in US dollars) of one share of Apple stock at that time.
So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, that means stockPrices[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stockPrices and returns the best profit I could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.

For example:

  const stockPrices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];

getMaxProfit(stockPrices);
// Returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

No "shorting"—you need to buy before you can sell. Also, you can't buy and sell in the same time step—at least 1 minute has to pass.
