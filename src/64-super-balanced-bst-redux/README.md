Write a function to see if a binary tree is "superbalanced" (a new tree property we just made up).

A tree is "superbalanced" if the difference between the depths of any two leaf nodes ↴ is no greater than one.

Here's a sample binary tree node class:
```javascript
  class BinaryTreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }

  insertLeft(value) {
    this.left = new BinaryTreeNode(value);
    return this.left;
  }

  insertRight(value) {
    this.right = new BinaryTreeNode(value);
    return this.right;
  }
}
```
