You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.

Write a function reverseWords() that takes a message as an array of characters and reverses the order of the words in place. ↴

Why an array of characters instead of a string?

The goal of this question is to practice manipulating strings in place. Since we're modifying the message, we need a mutable ↴ type like an array, instead of JavaScript's immutable strings.

For example:

```
  const message = [ 'c', 'a', 'k', 'e', ' ',
                'p', 'o', 'u', 'n', 'd', ' ',
                's', 't', 'e', 'a', 'l' ];

reverseWords(message);

console.log(message.join(''));
// Prints: 'steal pound cake'
```

When writing your function, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, and all words are separated by one space.
