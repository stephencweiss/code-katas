100 marbles in the jar. Types = [Sustainability, PEG, Industrial Goods, Retail, TMT, Pharma, Healthcare]. Marbles = [5, 30, 15, 15, 5, 10, 20].
My preferences = [1, 7, 6, 5, 2, 4, 3]
A random variable that takes a 1 with probability p and 0 with probability 1-p has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p (Python has libraries with a function that takes p as an argument and produces a 1 or a 0 according to a Bernoulli distribution)
In our example, i think p = # of marbles of the right type left in the jar / total # of marbles left in the jar
Number of draws per sample = 3
Number of samples = 6
